# IDEA STAGE
## give each object a vis cone as in viscone.java  
    - clear the array each time befor creation  
## give each object a BOOL did_move  
    - boolean is false if the item did not auto move on prximity alert (viscone move)
    - set that bool back to false once going through the moving method  
## run arr create once at the beginning and do not do a ori creation test again
## IMPLEMENT A RANDOM TURN AT EVERY % %MAX X/Y VISCONE MAX% to ensure max spread
## IMPLEMENT a dead team
## create a pos arr for every cycle
## move everything bool did_move false else set false
