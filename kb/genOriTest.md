## basic idea is that we will only test with increasind Y values along on if the other object will move along with our to test object  
  
# STEPS  
  
create the unique object with random X Y TEAM ORI  
    throught the prior 2 vector method with testing that checks that there are no two objects with the same possition  
  
gen a plane with ori numbers called ORIPLANE  
  
gen a plane with vectore i numbers called VECPLANE  
  
iterate along the X axis like  
for y  
    for x  

check if there is a where x.ori == this.ori use a object function equalsOri(obj o)    
 x  
xcx  
    if the obj is x == 0 do except left x if the obj is x == x.max so either
    x    x
    cx  xc

# important
try handling in a later step we first want detection working here
