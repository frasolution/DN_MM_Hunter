# Files in this folder are proof of concept files
## ArrPassTest
passing arrays and values from and to functions
## InboundTest --useless?
generating a more easy to work with array  
smelltest is still needed for out of bound safe checks on the outside7
## moveTestr (all of them)
main point is to move array values all in one direction to maybe gen moving texts and so on
## moveTestDir  
    ## ISSUES  
    - refactor for all directions and all movementspeeds
testing if in a random envoirement the thing move in the right direction and will bound from borders
## objArrTest // outdated
gen valid arrays of a specific count here shortest-side/2
## genOriTest
gen a valid Vector of obj that will contain only objects that point in diffrent directions
## orientTest --DEV
gen an array with also valid directions
## smellTest
test if other thing is near by without violating out of bounds exception
## vectest
testing the viabilty of vectors instead of arrays for saving objects
## viscone
testing if an object will be detected by another object
