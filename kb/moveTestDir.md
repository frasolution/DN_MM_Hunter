#IDEAS

## Multiple movement speeds
- look to reuse code from inboundTest
    - #THERE IS NOTHING TO SALVAGE EXCEPT FINDING OUT WITH A FIELD WISE OR IF THERE WILL BE A HANDLNG NEEDED. THIS WILL MAKE THE PROCESSING TIME FROM CYCLE LESS STABLE THAN THE OTHER IDEA
- set up a test if the next move will be possible
    - if just execute it
    - if not do a random other direction
        - use the created method reroll() from genOriTest.java
        - then execute the rest of moves in that direction

## Mid random movement
