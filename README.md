# DN_MM_Hunter  

## The Team  
We are University student that are trying our best to fullfill our Tasks.  
  
## Aimed Scope  
* Make a simulation that shows various hunting stratgies for group hunting
    * each predator should be making decisions based upon their knowledge
    * predators hunt small pray alone
    * predators notify group when help is needed for larger prey
    * there are only cooperative and solo hunters
    * when cooperative hunting predators must stay within a group radius, while trying to corner the prey
    * prey is considered killed once one of the predators of a group has reached it
    * if the group of predators it not large enough the prey will retaliate
        * prey attacks the closest predator
        * prey kills closest predator if their atk is higher than the predator def
    * attacked predators try to escape the preys attack and rejoin the group by being in the group radius
    *  
* programmed with Java (not further specified)  
* there has to be a Visual representation of the hunters and hunted  
    * this can be a simple 2D grid based envoirement with colored singulare or groups of tiles
    * the hunter and predator should be diffrentiable
    * movement should be shown
    * a trail does is not given for the hunter (maybe debug version though)
* there has to be a GUI for the user to enter parameters that influence the GUI
